# Bank Management System

## Overview

The Bank Management System is a console-based application developed in Python using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The system simulates basic banking operations such as account creation, deposits, withdrawals, account management, and transaction history maintenance. Data persistence is achieved using CSV files, allowing account information and transaction records to be stored between program executions.
